# Beyond Mod0 Plan

### The main things I would like to focus on after Mod0 are:
  - Finishing all projects around the house related to moving
  - Setting up healtcare and appointments for myself through Cherokee Nation
  - Setting up a solid budget and autopay on all bills
  - Spending some time on each day of the week to continue practicing Javascript and working on my personal coding projects
  - Spending some time each week keeping up with Mod0 classmates
  - Spending lots of time with family and setting boundaries with them about my class/homework time
  - Establishing a routine date night time/activity with my wife
  - Making a meal prep plan for weeks with class
  - Deep cleaning the entire house, laundry and yard
  - Reflecting on Mod0 and my successes/failures within
  
### The next couple weeks should look something like this:
